### Search algorithms
These actual codes are algorithm experiments on
the 8-puzzle problem. The problem was solved by 3 aproaches:

- A* with the manhathan distance as heuristic
- A* with sum of non-in-final-place pieces heuristic
- breadth-first search algorithm

### TicTacToe competitive agent

- ttt.py
  Implements a tic tac toe game which intelligent
  agent (the machine) uses the minimax algorithm to
  make the best moves

To do:
- [ ] implement minimax with heuristics
